# Black Friday


Our challenge is to have an app which ...


We will start with a class Products that will help us describe the products. We have to create at least 5 products with name, brand, price.


class Products(...):
    ...

Once a product has been created, it cannot be updated???
We can use the method def price_after_discount we will calculate the price of products after discount applied according to the known discount percentage.
We cand also use a method that gives the lowest / highest price, which compare the price of same product sold by different brands. 



We will also have a online store class that is a mutable sequence that holds our products.

class OnlineStore(...):
    ...
    

We can add and delete products from the store.
